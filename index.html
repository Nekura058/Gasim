    <h2>History and Geography</h2>
    <p>
        Sudan's history is a long and complex one, marked by periods of ancient kingdoms like Kush, colonial rule, and internal conflict. The region has seen the rise and fall of powerful empires, including the Kingdom of Kush, which rivaled ancient Egypt, and later, Islamic kingdoms like Sennar and Darfur. Sudan also experienced periods of Egyptian and British rule before gaining independence in 1956. The country has been plagued by civil wars, notably between the north and south, which ultimately led to the secession of South Sudan in 2011.
